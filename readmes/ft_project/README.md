## 🛸 42 São Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
