## üè´ 42 S√£o Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers or classrooms.
- Students learn from and correct eachother's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- The methodology develops technical and social skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process - **The Piscine**

It's an amazing project, and I'm enjoying every second of it.
